This is a demo program for the colecovision library.

It consists of a white cursor on black background that can be moved by:
* The joystick
* The super action controller weels
* The roller controller

Cursor.rom is a binary image for ColecoVision that can be burned on cartridges or used in an emulator.
Cursor.ihx is an image for ColecoVision in Intel hex format that can be burned on cartridges.
Cursor.png contains the image used for the cursor.
main.c contains the program's source code.

cursor.png.sprite.c has been generated from cursor.png using
png2cvs --big cursor.png

main.o has been generated from main.c using
sdcc -mz80 -c "-I../../include/" main.c

cursor.png.sprite.o has been generated from cursor.png.sprite.c using
sdcc -mz80 -c "-I../../include/" cursor.png.sprite.c 

crt0.ihx has been generated from main.o and cursor.png.sprite.o using
sdcc -mz80 --no-std-crt0 --code-loc 0x8100 --data-loc 0x7000 "../../bin/libcvu.lib" "../../bin/libcv.lib" "../../bin/crt0.rel" *.rel -o Cursor.ihx

Cursor.rom has been generated from Cursor.ihx using
objcopy --input-target=ihex --output-target=binary Cursor.ihx Cursor.rom
