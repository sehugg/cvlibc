This is a demo program for the colecovision library.

It shows how to use compression for graphics data.
It will display a blank screen while decompressing.
After that it will display picture.png.
The sample picture included is compressed from 12K to 2K.

Type "make" to generate Cursor.ihx and cursor.rom from the input files.
Type "make clean" to remove all generated files except Cursor.rom.

The Makefile assumes that png2cv is installed and the compression tools live in ../../../compression.
