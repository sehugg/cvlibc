This is the colecovision library. It is meant for developing games and other applications for the following video game systems, and makes portability easy.

* ColecoVision
* SG-1000
* SC-3000
* Mark III
* Master System

The library can be build using "make". Different versions will be built for the ColecoVision, and for the Sega consoles.

The most recent version and tutorials can be found at http://www.colecovision.eu.

It consists three parts:

libcv: A low level library to provide access to the video game system hardware from C.
libcvu: A higher-level library that builds on libcv and provides convenience functions. 
demos: Various demo programs showing how to use the library.

Example:
libcv provides functions to set the graphics memory access pointer and different functions to transfer data from/to graphics memory.
libcvu provides a cvu_memtovmemcpy(), which copies data from memory to graphics memory. It takes three arguments: Destination, pointer to source, number of bytes to copy. It uses libcv to set the graphics memory acces pointer and selects the correct data transfer function depending on current screen mode.

All libcv and libcvu functions are documented in the header files.

The implementation of some libcv and libcvu functions is hand-optimized assembler.
